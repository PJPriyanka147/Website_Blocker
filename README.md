# Website_Blocker

## Overview
**Website_Blocker** is a Python-based tool designed to help users enhance productivity by blocking access to distracting websites during specified hours. This tool modifies the systemâ€™s hosts file to redirect specified websites to localhost, effectively preventing access to them during working hours.

## Features
- **Block Specific Websites**: Easily block access to websites that you find distracting.
- **Customizable Blocking Schedule**: Set specific hours during which the websites will be blocked.
<!-- **Logging**: Keep a log of the websites that were blocked, along with timestamps.-->
<!-- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.-->

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10.11
- Administrator or root access (to modify the hosts file)

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Website_Blocker.git
   cd Website_Blocker
## Usage ðŸš€

1. **Edit the `websites.txt` File**
   - List the URLs of the websites you want to block, one per line.
   - **Example:**
     ```
     www.facebook.com
     www.youtube.com
     ```
2. **Configure the Blocking Schedule**
   - Modify the `start_hour` and `end_hour` Variables.
   - Adjust these variables in the script to set the blocking period.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     start_hour = 9
     end_hour = 17
     ```
3. **Run the Script**
   ```
   python website_blocker.py
   ```
4. **Stopping the Block**
   - To stop the block and revert changes, either wait for the blocking period to end or manually remove the entries from the hosts file.
   
## How it Works
- The script reads the list of websites from websites.txt.
- During the specified hours, it writes entries to the systemâ€™s hosts file, redirecting the websites to 127.0.0.1 (localhost).
- After the blocking period, the script removes these entries, restoring normal access.
